**TaskRaft** is a compact mini-SaaS designed for collaborative task management using the efficient Kanban system. Built using the MERN Stack, along with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) at the frontend. TaskRaft draws inspiration from task management apps like [Tasksboard](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Trello](https://trello.com/), offering a simplified yet robust approach. [Tanstack Query](https://example.com/tanstack-query) and [Zustand](https://example.com/zustand) are used for server-side and global state management respectively. User authentication is handled through JSON Web Tokens (JWT), while data modeling relies on [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
